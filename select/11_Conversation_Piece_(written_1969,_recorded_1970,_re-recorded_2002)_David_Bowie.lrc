[00:07.39] I took this walk to ease my mind
[00:13.56] To find out what's gnawing at me
[00:17.52] Wouldn't think to look at me
[00:24.47] That I've spent a lot of time in education
[00:30.02] All seems so long ago
[00:36.87] I'm a thinker, not a talker
[00:42.60] No one to talk to, anyway
[00:55.10] 
[00:45.57] I can't see the road
[00:48.84] For the rain in my eyes
[00:56.26] Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
[01:03.76] 
[01:03.46] I live above the grocers store
[01:09.71] Owned by an Austrian
[01:13.79] Often calls me down to eat
[01:20.64] And he jokes about his broken English
[01:26.22] Tries to be a friend to me
[01:32.97] But for all my years of reading conversation
[01:38.53] I stand without a word to say
[01:53.03] 
[01:41.24] I can't see the bridge
[01:44.95] For the rain in my eye
[01:52.23] Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
[01:59.73] 
[01:59.59] And the world is full of life
[02:05.69] Full of folk who don't know me
[02:09.49] And they walk in twos or threes or more
[02:16.66] While the light that shines above the grocer's store
[02:21.67] Investigates my face so rudely
[02:29.14] And my essays lying scattered on the floor
[02:33.95] Fulfill their needs just by being there
[02:53.45] 
[02:37.15] And my hands shake, my head hurts
[02:39.82] My voice sticks inside my throat
[02:42.47] I'm invisible and dumb and no one will recall me
[03:06.47] 
[02:49.38] And I can't see the water
[02:53.61] Through the tears in my eyes
