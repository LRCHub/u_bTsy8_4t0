[00:15.49] I took this walk to ease my mind
[00:20.96] To find out what's gnawing at me
[00:23.66] Wouldn't think to look at me,
[00:30.33] That I've spent a lot of time in education
[00:34.94] It all seems so long ago
[00:42.14] I'm a thinker, not a talker
[00:45.82] I've no-one to talk to, anyway
[01:00.82] 
[00:51.27] I can't see the road
[00:53.08] For the rain in my eyes
[01:00.30] Ahhh ...
[01:04.30] 
[01:07.45] I live above the grocers store,
[01:12.91] Owned by an austrian
[01:15.78] He often calls me down to eat
[01:22.96] And he jokes about his broken english,
[01:26.67] Tries to be a friend to me
[01:32.97] But for all my years of reading conversation,
[01:39.33] I stand without a word to say
[01:53.83] 
[01:42.90] I can't see the bridge
[01:45.63] For the rain in my eye
[01:52.00] Ahhh...
[01:55.50] 
[01:59.22] And the world is full of life
[02:02.93] Full of folk who don't know me
[02:08.34] And they walk in twos or threes or mor
[02:14.65] While the light that shines above the grocer's store
[02:20.11] Investigates my face so rudely
[02:26.96] And my essays lying scattered on the floor
[02:31.48] Fulfill their needs just by being there
[02:35.06] And my hands shake, my head hurts,
[02:36.90] My voice sticks inside my throat
[02:39.67] I'm invisible and dumb,
[02:41.45] And no-one will recall me
[02:53.95] 
[02:45.98] And I can't see the water
[02:50.54] Through the tears in my ey-y-yes
